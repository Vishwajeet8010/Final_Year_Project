# Malicious Email Detection Using Rule-Based Techniques

## Overview
This project aims to detect malicious emails (e.g., phishing, spam, or malware-laden emails) using a rule-based approach. The system analyzes email content and metadata to identify patterns commonly associated with malicious intent. This is achieved through predefined rules that check for suspicious keywords, sender information, links, attachments, and other indicators.

The project is designed as a proof-of-concept for email security and can be extended or integrated into larger systems for real-time email filtering.

## Features
- Detects malicious emails based on predefined rules. (New rules yet to be added.)
- Analyzes email content for suspicious keywords and phrases.
- Checks sender information and domain reputation.
- Identifies malicious URLs and attachments.
- Provides a simple output indicating whether an email is safe or malicious.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Regular Expressions (for pattern matching)
- File parsing (e.g., `.txt`, `.eml` files)
- Rule-based logic for classification

## Installation
